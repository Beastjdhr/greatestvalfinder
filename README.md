# Adding Visual and Interactive Features to Phylogenetic Trees
  This tutorial was designed for Ubuntu users and it assumes you already have a phylogenetic tree stored in the Newick format.
## Saving a Tree as XML/PhyloXML (in case it is not in any of these formats)  

In order to make your tree a little more appealing to the eye, it must be in an XML format. To change its format from Newick,
  go to the following website:
    https://phyd3.bits.vib.be/view.php?id=71d752e8b21452c2dcd8267f94a58bb7.xml&f=xml
    Once you have opened your tree, choose the option: "Download as XML".	
  	### Download the necessary libraries
    The following libraries will be used to make your tree look better:
	    Raphael (js library): https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DmitryBaranovskiy/raphael/master/raphael.min.js
		    jsPhyloSVG: https://github.com/guyleonard/jsPhyloSVG/blob/master/jsphylosvg-min.js
			  jQuery 1.4.2: http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.4.2.min.js
